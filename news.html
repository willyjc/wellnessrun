Hopkins Wellness Run: Raising Awareness of Chronic Conditions 
Hopkins Hospitals is proud to present the Hopkins Wellness Run, a flagship event aimed at fostering awareness and education around chronic health conditions. Taking place on November 10th, 2024, this run is not just about physical activity—it’s a collective call to action for understanding, preventing, and managing chronic conditions that impact our families, friends, and neighbors every day. With full support from the county’s Governor and a special appearance by Kenya’s Paraplegic Team, the Hopkins Wellness Run stands as a testament to the power of community health initiatives and the importance of working together to improve quality of life.
Chronic health conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and respiratory illnesses, affect millions worldwide, and our own community is no exception. Many people live with these conditions, yet awareness about their causes, symptoms, and preventive measures remains limited. Through this run, Hopkins Hospitals aims to shine a light on these prevalent issues and emphasize the critical role that early detection, lifestyle changes, and proper management play in reducing the burden of chronic illness. The Hopkins Wellness Run is designed to engage participants and spectators alike in meaningful conversations about their health and well-being, with resource stations, interactive activities, and expert speakers available throughout the event.
We invite you, your family, and your friends to join us on November 10th for a day that celebrates health, wellness, and resilience. Whether you’re running, walking, or cheering from the sidelines, your participation helps build a healthier, stronger community. The Hopkins Wellness Run is more than a day of physical activity; it’s a demonstration of our shared commitment to making our county a place where every resident has access to the knowledge and resources needed to lead a fulfilling, healthy life. Come be a part of a movement that goes beyond fitness—it’s a journey towards lasting health for everyone.
Let’s come together to make a lasting impact on the health of our community. See you at the starting line!
